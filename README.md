Organization Search Engine

Filtering: Users can apply filters to narrow down search results based on various attributes such as organization type, location, industry, size, etc.
Dynamic Results: The search engine dynamically updates the results based on the applied filters and search query.
User-Friendly Interface: The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to quickly find the information they are looking for.

Technologies Used
